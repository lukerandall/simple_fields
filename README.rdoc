= Simple Fields
Simple fields is a really simple form helper method. It's more than likely not going to be useful to anyone but me, since it is little more than a helper method to create a field with a label and optionally, a description and popup explanation.

It does not try to figure out the field type you want  -- you need to pass it a +:field_type+ if you need it to be something other than a text field.

It facilitates creating nice, clean forms using very little code.
